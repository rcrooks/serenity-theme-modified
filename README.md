## About

This is a very minor modification of Roman Chesnokov's beautiful [Serenity Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rchesnokov.serenity-theme). Serenity was my favorite from the first time I tried it. I just had one tiny issue with it: non-selected line numbers were so dark that I couldn't read them, which was a problem for me because I often work on very long files and need to find a section by the line numbers.
